## Defining a list

If you want to create a list and you know the elements already then you can do it like this.

## Changing element values

```python
aList = [ 'Alice', 'Shahneila', 'Bob', 'Tariq' ]
```

With an existing list you can directly change any of its elements `aList[1] = 'Sean'` sets the 2nd element of the list `aList` to `'Sean'`. List indexes start at `0`. Run the code on the left by clicking the button below to see this in action.

The next section will show you how to append new elements to the end of the list, or insert new elemenets at specific indexes.
