You can easily set an list element with the same techniques.

`numArray[4] = 100` sets the 5th element of list called `numArray` to `100`.

## Defining an list
If you want to create a list and you know the elements already (which is not that often the case) then you can do it like this.

```python
numArray = [1, 55, 3, 16]
```

But often you will not have any elements to start with and will want to add them later. 

In this case, you should create an empty list like this first.

```python
numArray = []
```

## Run the code
Take a look at the code on the left. 

{Run code}(python3 run-user.py ./1-lists/example2.py)

This shows how you 

1. Define a new list
1. Assign values to list elements (note we are not assigning values to *contiguous* elements)
1. Show each list element

When you run the code, notice how some of the elements are *undefined*. This is because we added two elements.
