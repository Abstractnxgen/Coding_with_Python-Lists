## Defining a list

If you want to create a list and you know the elements already then you can create a list by doing this:

```python
aList = [ 'Alice', 'Shahneila', 'Bob', 'Tariq' ]
```

## Changing element values

If you have an existing list you can directly change any of it's elements. For example, `aList[1]='Sean'` sets the 2nd element of the list `aList` to `'Sean'`. The list index starts at `0`, so you use `1` to change the second list element. Run the code on the left to see an example.

{Run code}(python3 content/1-lists/example2.py)

The next section will show you how to append (add on) new elements to the end of the list, or insert new elemenets in specific places.
