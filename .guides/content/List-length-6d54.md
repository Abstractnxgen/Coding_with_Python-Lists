When working with lists you often need to know how many elements are in the list, or simply put, its length!

## len()

The `len()` function can tell you the length of many different types. You have already seen it used for finding the length of strings.

```python
aString = '12345'
print(len(aString))
```

You can also use it to find out the length of lists.

```python
aList = [1,2,3,4,5]
print(len(aList))
```

Add or remove some elements from the list and run the example again to see how the length changes.
