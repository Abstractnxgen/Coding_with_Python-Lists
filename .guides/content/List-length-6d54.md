When you are working with lists you often need to know how many elements (values or variables) are in the list, or simply put, it's length!

## len()

The `len()` function can tell you the length of many different data types. You have seen it before, when it was used to find the length of strings:

```python
aString = '12345'
print(len(aString))
```

You can also use it to find out the length of lists:

```python
aList = [1,2,3,4,5]
print(len(aList))
```

Experiment by adding or removing some elements from the list, then run the example again to see how the length changes.
