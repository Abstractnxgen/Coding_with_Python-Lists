We assume that you have already done the Flode Arrays Unit and are now familiar with the concept of arrays. 

{Run the code on the left}(python run-user.py ./1-lists/example1.py)

## Creating lists
List creation in Python works in exactly the same way as arrays in Flode. The Flode chart on the left shows the Flode ways of creating arrays.

### String lists
You create a string list like this

```python
strArray = ['Alice', 'Shahneila', 'Bobx, 'Tariq']
```

### Number lists
Here's an example of a number list

```python
numArray = [1, 3.141, 5, 17.1, 100]
```

### Empty list
If you plan to create your own list then you need to create an empty list variable before you add data to it.

```python
numArray = []
numArray.append(4)
```
