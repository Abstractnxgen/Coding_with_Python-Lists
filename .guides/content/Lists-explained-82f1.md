We assume that you have already done the Flode Arrays Unit and are now familiar with the concept of arrays. (If not, we recommend that you do. It is available in the An Introduction to Programming > Flode course)

{Run the code on the left}(python3 content/1-lists/example1.py Alice,Shahneila,Bobx,Tariq 1,3.141,5,17.1,100)

## Creating lists
List creation in Python works in exactly the same way as arrays in Flode. 

### String lists
You create a string list like this

```python
strList = ['Alice', 'Shahneila', 'Bobx, 'Tariq']
```

### Number lists
Here's an example of a number list

```python
numList = [1, 3.141, 5, 17.1, 100]
```

### Empty list
If you plan to create your own list then you need to create an empty list variable before you add data to it.

```python
numList = []
numList.append(4)
```
